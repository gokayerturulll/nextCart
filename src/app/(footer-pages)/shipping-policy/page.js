          <p>
            The shipment of your product is our highest priority and everyday we
            dispatch hundreds of products to satisfied customers across the
            world. However, because the majority of our warehouses are
            internationally-based, our shipping and handling times can vary and
            we are therefore unable to offer next day delivery.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">Processing time</h2>
          <p>
            As soon as we receive your payment, we immediately dispatch your
            order to our suppliers for order verification, tailoring, quality
            check and packaging which can take an additional 1-2 business days.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">Shipping time</h2>
          <p>
            This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our
            warehouse to the destination, which typically takes 4-7 business
            days, although actual shipping times may vary.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">Total Time</h2>
          <p>
            Generally the total time depends on the locations of your orders
            warehouse. As we mentioned above, if it is an imported product the
            total time will be 5-10 business days. For local products this time
            is around 2-5 business days.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-bold text-2xl">Tracking</h2>
          <p>
            As soon as your order is shipped, you will receive a confirmation
            email containing a tracking number allowing you to easily locate
            your product directly from our website at any time Please note that
            while the majority of our shipping companies provide a tracking
            service, we cannot guarantee it in all cases.
